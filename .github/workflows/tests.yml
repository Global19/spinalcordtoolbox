# caveats
# - the nightlies; i've marked them all with `nightly: true` or `nightly: false` to keep them straight but that variable is actually used anywhere which means it's bug-prone
# - the extra matrix.dependencies step is awkward; i don't know how to avoid it though
# - `which` should be removed from this when #3102 gets merged
# - when the nightlies don't run they still show up in the UI as a single job, but with name "    name: ${{matrix.name || matrix.os || 'Nightlies' }}
#   sooo that sucks
# - annoying that test-wsl can't be inlined with the other tests
#   it seems like it should be possible: it should work the same way as the `container:` cases; except specifying `container` when `runs-on: windows-2019` crashes, even if the value of container is empty?
# - the linting step in .ci.sh should become a separate .lint.sh with a separate workflows/lint.yml

# The set of available runners on Github's infra is generous but
# will never be complete: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on
# to cover other Linux distros, we use docker images.
# This isn't a perfect test but it's pretty good.

    # Even when given -y, apt will still sometimes hang at a prompt if a package
